LPrint - Label Printer Utility
==============================

LPrint implements printing for a variety of common label and receipt printers
connected via network or USB.  Features include:

- A single executable handles spooling, status, and server functionality.
- Multiple printers can be managed.
- Implements an IPP Everywhere print service.
- Exposes printer-specific options such as print darkness, resolution, and
  speed.
- Can print "raw", PWG Raster, and PNG files.

LPrint depends on the [CUPS software](https://www.cups.org) to provide the
